## Why eNuts?
eNuts is a privacy-focused custodial wallet that not only allows you to perform lightning transactions but also private Ecash transactions using the Cashu protocol.

It comes with a basic Nostr integration because we believe Ecash and Nostr are a match made in heaven. Ecash combined with Nostr’s inherent resistance to censorship creates a potent combination.

Furthermore, eNuts is designed with an intuitive interface that streamlines every step of your Ecash journey. Enjoy instant payments and privacy features backed by Bitcoin and Cashu’s architecture.
